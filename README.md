Problem Statement:
As a beginner in data analytics, the objective of this assignment is to analyze the UK road accident dataset and gain insights into factors affecting road safety and accident severity. By examining the dataset, we aim to explore various aspects of road accidents and address the following questions. By addressing these questions and conducting exploratory analysis on the UK road accident dataset, we aim to gain insights into road safety and accident prevention.
In this Dashboard we can see:
ğŸ’  Total Casualties, average speed limit.
ğŸ’  Which police force has the highest number of reported accidents?
ğŸ’  Which districts have the more than 1000 number of reported accidents?
ğŸ’  Which vehicle types are involved in the highest number of accidents?
ğŸ’  Relationship between the number of vehicles involved in an accident and the average of casualties.
ğŸ’  Trend of accidents over date (year, qtr, months and even day) in the UK.
ğŸ’  Are there certain junction types that are more commonly associated with accidents?
ğŸ’  Which districts are the most affected in terms of accidents?
ğŸ’  How do road surface conditions affect accident severity?

Insights:
ğŸ’  T junctions are the hotspot for accidents.
ğŸ’  Cars vehicle are more prone to accidents.
ğŸ’  Westminster, Lambeth, Barnet are the districts with more than 1000 accidents.
ğŸ’  As the number of vehicles involved in accident increases, the average casualties increases.
ğŸ’  Dry road surfaces are accident prone zones.
ğŸ’  98% accidents were investigated by Metropolitan police.


Recommendation:
ğŸ’  Keep T junction ahead and speed limitation board road sign.
ğŸ’  Conduct road safety programs in various districts.
